Today my Twitter account (<a href="https://twitter.com/SageofPHY6Paths" target="_blank">@SageofPHY6Paths</a>) was permanently suspended. I saw that coming. Before this, even when I post a comment, it will have 0 views, and the person to whom I replied can't even see it because Twitter has shadow banned me. Antireligious activism will obviously offend people, and they will report the tweets. But they shouldn't have permanently suspended me. That guy Musk is recently even allowing racists etc but somehow atheist activism is not allowed. They are only supporting bigotry, not free speech.

So, I just decided to make this blog. It's better than relying on those companies. Even in the worst case GitHub bans atheist activism I will have the source code and I can host it by myself.
